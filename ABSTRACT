 Abstract
In today's digital age, the security of online accounts and sensitive information is paramount. A Password Generator is a tool designed to create strong, random passwords that enhance security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

This project focuses on developing a Python-based password generator that allows users to specify criteria such as password length and the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated passwords are complex and difficult to guess, thereby providing robust protection against brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

The application utilizes Python's built-in libraries to generate random characters based on user-defined criteria. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

By implementing this project, users can generate secure passwords tailored to their specific needs, enhancing the overall security of their digital presence.
